# Desert-Highway
This visual work harmonizes natural and man-made elements to portray a beautiful  highway through a desert landscape. The desert landscape has dynamic elements  such as layered mountains, random rocks, stylized cactus trees, moving clouds  over the sky, and an intense sunâ€”all placed with care to symbolize the dry but  vibrant desert landscape.
