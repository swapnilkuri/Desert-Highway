# Desert-Highway
This visual work harmonizes natural and man-made elements to portray a beautiful highway through a desert landscape. The desert landscape has dynamic elements such as layered mountains, random rocks, stylized cactus trees, moving clouds over the sky, and an intense sun—all placed with care to symbolize the dry but vibrant desert landscape. One of the most robust features of the project is the interactive day and night shift, allowing users to view the desert in different light conditions. An animated bright red car moves down the highway, providing a sense of movement and realism to the scene. The systematic layering of the project—from the sandy ground and hills 
to the dark brown highway—offers a deep and immersive setting. "Desert Highway" captures not only the technical ability of OpenGL/GLUT to render 2D scenes but also aesthetic storytelling using environment design and animation.
